# Decision Log

> **Purpose**: The "why" file. An **append-only** log of every meaningful decision —
> which library was chosen and why, architecture choices, feature decisions, branch
> decisions, tradeoffs. When anyone (human or AI) wonders "why is it built this way?",
> the answer is here.
>
> **Update rule (MANDATORY)**: Append a new entry for EVERY meaningful decision.
> **Never edit or delete past entries** — that would rewrite history and break the
> log's purpose. Before making a new decision, check this log first (don't decide
> twice).

## What counts as a "meaningful decision"? (MANDATORY — log all of these)

- **Library / framework / tool choice** — component library, icon set, state manager, animation lib, styling approach
- **Architecture / pattern choice** — folder structure, data flow, error strategy, server vs client components
- **Feature design decisions** — scope, UX, API shape, data model
- **Branch / workflow decisions** — git flow, release process, deployment target
- **Anything you had to think about for more than ~5 seconds**

## How to add a decision

1. Copy the **Template** below into the **Decision Entries** section (newest on top)
2. Fill it in — the **Why** line is the most important part
3. Add a row to the **Decision Index** table
4. If it supersedes an earlier decision, mark the old one as `Superseded by ADR-NNN`

## Decision Index

| ID | Date | Decision | Status | Affects |
|----|------|----------|--------|---------|
| ADR-003 | 2026-08-11 | Remove Scaffold.py; canonical trees are the source of truth | Accepted | repo root, folder-structure skill |
| ADR-002 | 2026-08-11 | Add flow.md + decision.md as living context files | Accepted | context/, all docs |
| ADR-001 | YYYY-MM-DD | [One-line decision] | Accepted | [files/features] |

## Template

### ADR-NNN: [Short title]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded by ADR-NNN
- **Context**: [what triggered this decision — the problem being solved]
- **Options considered**: [alternatives, and why each was rejected]
- **Decision**: [what was chosen]
- **Why**: [the reasoning — this is the important part. Write enough that a future agent
  understands without re-deriving it.]
- **Consequences**: [positive and negative effects, things to watch out for]
- **Affects**: [features / files / branches this touches]

## Decision Entries

<!-- Newest decisions go at the top of this section. Keep this section growing — it is
     the living memory of the project. Delete the two example entries below once you
     have real decisions. -->

### ADR-003: Remove Scaffold.py — canonical trees are the source of truth
- **Date**: 2026-08-11
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Scaffold.py generated a folder skeleton, but `npm install` / create-app already provides boilerplate. The generator produced a generic tree that ignored per-project needs and duplicated what the `folder-structure` skill already defines.
- **Options considered**: Keep Scaffold.py but improve it (extra maintenance, still redundant with the skill); remove it and rely on the canonical trees (chosen).
- **Decision**: Delete Scaffold.py. The `folder-structure` skill (`.agents/folder-structure/SKILL.md`) is the single source of truth; agents materialize its canonical trees by hand, creating only folders the product needs.
- **Why**: One source of truth instead of two. The skill's trees are the "senior engineer" hierarchy — feature-first frontend, controller-service-repository backend. Remove the Python dependency from the workflow.
- **Consequences**: Agents must create folders manually — the skill's Step 2 shows how. All docs updated (Agent.md, SKILLS.md, README.md, .agents/AGENTS.md).
- **Affects**: repo root, `.agents/folder-structure/SKILL.md`, all docs referencing it

### ADR-002: Add `flow.md` + `decision.md` as living context files
- **Date**: 2026-08-11
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Agents couldn't understand the project instantly and didn't update context properly. `progress-tracker.md` alone didn't capture HOW the app works (function call maps, user flows) or WHY decisions were made.
- **Options considered**: Fold this info into existing files (overloaded, no single "how/why" home); new dedicated files (chosen).
- **Decision**: Create `context/flow.md` (Mermaid call maps, user flows, request/response, routes) and `context/decision.md` (append-only ADR log). Both are updated on EVERY task, alongside `progress-tracker.md`.
- **Why**: Reading the three files (progress-tracker + flow + decision) gives state, structure, and rationale instantly. Decision log prevents re-deciding and preserves reasoning.
- **Consequences**: Agents must keep diagrams in sync; stale diagrams are treated as bugs. Sync protocol is enforced via AGENTS.md + Agent.md.
- **Affects**: `context/`, `AGENTS.md`, `Agent.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `.agents/AGENTS.md`, `ai-workflow-rules.md`

### ADR-001: Choose Next.js 16 + TypeScript
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need an SSR-capable framework with strong typing for a multi-page product.
- **Options considered**: React + Vite (no SSR, worse SEO), Astro (less dynamic for app routes), SvelteKit (smaller ecosystem for the team).
- **Decision**: Next.js 16 + TypeScript.
- **Why**: SSR/SSG out of the box, App Router supports the feature-first layout, TypeScript strict mode is a hard requirement, largest ecosystem.
- **Consequences**: Must default to server components; avoid heavy client bundles.
- **Affects**: entire app

### ADR-002: [Example — component library choice]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need form controls and modals for the [feature] section.
- **Options considered**: HeroUI (too heavy to default), MUI (banned), custom (slow).
- **Decision**: Pull the [X] components from Astryx, animate with [Y].
- **Why**: Matches the design language in `ui-context.md`; copy-paste ownership preferred per `DESIGN.md`.
- **Consequences**: [things to watch out for]
- **Affects**: `features/<feature>/components/`
